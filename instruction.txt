Create a Room Slot Booking Django Project that does the following;

    Authenticate the user

        Allow new users to sign up

        Allow existing users to sign in

    Users are of two types: Room Manager & Customer.

    Room Manager should be able to define the number of Rooms available.

    A Room Manager can define the Time Slots for which a Room is available every day.

    Time slots are constantly recurring.

    A Customer can book a Room and a corresponding Time Slot, once booked, the Room cannot be booked by another Customer for that Time Slot.

    Allow only an authenticated user to Book or set Rooms

    A Customer should only be able to book a Room ‘x’ days in advance. Room Manager should be able to define the number of days ‘x’.

    Only Room Manager can add, delete or change his own number of Rooms and Time Slots.

    A Customer should be able to view and delete only his own bookings

    Room Manager should be able to view a summary of all bookings, occupancies and occupant customer details.

    The customer should be able to see all of his own (past and future) bookings, occupancies and room manager.

    Write Test Cases for your Django App.
